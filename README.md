# BIUI stands for blender inspired user interface.

I love blender's UI so much, I have to do this.
I want to thank all people working on blender,
it's such a masterpeace!

This work is based on UX of blender.
I am not into blender's source code.
So, i may do thing wrongly in software design.

This lib depends on pygame. I use pygame just for window, drawing 
in the Theme class and in __init__.py and for event handling.
I want to keep the lib in python, i hope it's not going to be laggy.
